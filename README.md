```
I use AI to assist with the following needs: whether itâ€™s for debugging errors, figuring out which packages to download for the functions I want to use, or reorganizing messy code to make it neat and clean. Additionally, I use it to explain unfamiliar code or concepts clearly with examples. Most of the data provided by AI is highly helpful, significantly saving time and reducing the workload.
